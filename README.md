## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

GitHub has a feature called "forking" that allows you to create a copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This is useful for contributing to projects or simply having your own version of a project to work on. Here's how you can fork a repository:

1. Go to the repository lecture's repository: `https://github.com/amis-4630/sp-26-lecture-7`
2. Click on the "Fork" button located at the top right corner of the repository page.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your own account (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/sp-26-lecture-7`).
4. You can now clone this forked repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/your-username/sp-26-lecture-7.git
   ```

5. Navigate into the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd sp-26-lecture-7
   ```

6. You can now make changes to the code, commit those changes, and push them back to your forked repository on GitHub.
